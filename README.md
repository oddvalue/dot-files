## Notes

This setup is highly customised to my specific needs. It's not likely to be suitable for many, if any, other people.

That said, feel free to use it as a starting point for your own dot-file setup.

## Installation

```bash
  git clone git@github.com:oddvalue/dot-files.git .dot-files
  cd .dot-files
  ./install.sh
```
